# docs-sitemap

This is a simple tool to build a sitemap index for [Crystal API docs](https://crystal-lang.org/api).

See https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-website/issues/79 for details.

* it queries the index file for each API version on https://crystal-lang.org/api
* it extracts each link from the navigation menu
* the links for each version are placed in a separate sitemap file and given a
  specific priority depending on how recent the version is
* references to all sitemaps are collected in a sitemap index file

## Usage

```shell
> crystal run src/app.cr
```

The program generates the individual sitemap files in `output/sitemaps/` and the
sitemap index at `output/sitemap-index.xml.gz`.
